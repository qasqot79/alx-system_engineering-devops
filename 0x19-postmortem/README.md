From this review, I would like to come up with an internal document that describes the outage, its effects, our response and the resolution henceforth.

The outage happened on the 21st  of February 2023,where there was a slip in banking services.Many customers logged in at the same time to perform several transactions and the server crashed when it  was over burdened.

Services Affected by the outage were transfers,charges for stamp duty,transfers charges and log-ins amongst other transactions.

Impact of the outage:A total of 50% of our customers were unable to log in into our server,those able to login were unable to complete their transactions,some transactions were performed but transfers were not completed or completed but never received by the receiver.

What was the impact on our users ? Our bank lost a whopping sum of 75 Billion.Many customers registered their dissatisfaction on our facebook page and some threatened to close their accounts with our bank.

 Outage Duration:The outage happened between 10a.m in the morning and it was resolved around 5 p.m on the fourth day.

Cause Including primary and secondary causes
The real course of the outage was lack of backup servers and errors in the code by one of our Software engineers.

Preventative measures to take: How do we prevent this outage from occurring again or reduce its impact?

We decided to have a backup server and engage a team of other software engineers to rectify the errors in the system.
In order to prevent such from happening in the future.The team of software engineers must submit their portfolio to the administrative boss for vetting.A backup power source has also been installed to prevent power outages in the future.

Resolution
We placed a notice on our social media pages and apologized for the inconveniences the crash might have caused.Some customers took it lightly and some were outraged and came to vandalize some of our branch facilities.Some of our staff had to run four-forty to escape attack.
