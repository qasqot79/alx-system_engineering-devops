How To Create a Pull Request on GitHub

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the default branch only contains finished and approved work.

If you want to create a new branch for your pull request and do not have write permissions to the repository, you can fork the repository first. For more information, see "Creating a pull request from a fork" and "About forks."

You can specify which branch you'd like to merge your changes into when you create your pull request. Pull requests can only be opened between two branches that are different.

You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request. For more information, see "Linking a pull request to an issue."
