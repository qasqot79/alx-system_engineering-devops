Design of Secured and Monitored Three-Server Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com:
Elements and Explanations:

Firewalls: The firewalls are added to enhance security by filtering and controlling incoming and outgoing traffic to the servers. They act as a barrier to potential threats and unauthorized access.

SSL Certificate (HTTPS): An SSL certificate is installed on the load balancer to enable HTTPS. This ensures encrypted communication between users and the web servers, enhancing data security and privacy.

Monitoring Clients: The monitoring clients collect data from each server, providing insights into server health, performance, and potential issues. They send this data to monitoring services like Sumo Logic for analysis.

Additional Explanations:

Firewalls: Firewalls are used to restrict unauthorized access and malicious traffic from reaching the servers. They act as a security layer to prevent potential attacks.

SSL Certificate and HTTPS: HTTPS is used to encrypt the data transmitted between users' browsers and the servers. This prevents eavesdropping and data manipulation during transit.

Monitoring: Monitoring tools are used to keep track of the servers' performance, resource usage, and potential issues. They help in identifying and addressing problems proactively.

Monitoring Data Collection: Monitoring clients collect data on various metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, and more. This data is sent to monitoring services for analysis and visualization.

Monitoring Web Server QPS: To monitor the web server's queries per second (QPS), you would set up monitoring tools to track incoming requests and calculate the rate of queries over a specific time period.

Issues with the Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at Load Balancer: Terminating SSL at the load balancer can lead to data being transmitted unencrypted between the load balancer and backend servers. End-to-end encryption is lost in this scenario.

Single MySQL Server for Writes: Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes creates a single point of failure. If this server goes down, write operations will be affected.

Uniform Server Components: If all servers have the same components (database, web server, application server), a problem or vulnerability affecting one component could potentially impact all servers simultaneously.

To address these issues, consider implementing end-to-end encryption, setting up a MySQL cluster for redundancy, and diversifying server components based on their roles for better fault tolerance.
